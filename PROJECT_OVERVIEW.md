# MultiPY - Interactive Multiplication Learning System

## Project Overview
An educational web application built with Django that helps students practice multiplication tables through interactive exercises and timed exams. This project demonstrates modern web development practices and educational software design principles.

## 🎯 Educational Goals
- **Student Engagement**: Interactive multiplication practice with immediate feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed analytics on student performance and learning patterns
- **Adaptive Learning**: Progressive difficulty based on student performance
- **Assessment Tools**: Comprehensive exam system with automated grading

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Django 3.0.6, Python 3.x
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in user authentication system
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 4 with custom CSS

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Model-View-Template (MVT) Pattern
- **Models**: Clean database schema with proper relationships
- **Views**: Separation of business logic and presentation
- **Templates**: Reusable HTML components with template inheritance

### Key Components
1. **User Management**: Role-based access control (Student/Teacher/Admin)
2. **Question Engine**: Dynamic question generation with multiple choice options
3. **Exam System**: Timed exams with automatic grading
4. **Progress Analytics**: Real-time progress tracking and visualization
5. **Permission System**: Granular permissions for different user types

## 📊 Database Design
- **User Authentication**: Extended Django user model with role management
- **Question/Answer System**: Flexible schema supporting various question types
- **Exam Management**: Comprehensive exam tracking with detailed results
- **Progress Tracking**: Time-series data for learning analytics
